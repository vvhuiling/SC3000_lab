In the Assignment, we used DQN to solve Cartpole problem.
You will find 4 files in this folder including this README.

SC3000Lab1DQN2.ipynb:
	This contains complete DQN model and its training process and detailed explaination.
model_weights.pth
	This contains necessary data of a pre-trained model to load.
cartpole.ipynb
	This contains a test envrionment to demostrate trained model. It would only work properly if model_weights.pth is put in same folder with it.
